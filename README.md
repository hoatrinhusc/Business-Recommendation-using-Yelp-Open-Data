# Business Recommendation using Yelp Open-Data
## Summary
In this project, I will use the raw data from [Yelp open dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset) to extract user and business information. 
Then I build a recommender to predict the rating score a user would give for a business. The recommender will recommend a business to a user if the rating score is high.
